	<p> Good afternoon Isabella!

Having followed Prism Creative Group for some time on social media, I was delighted to today that you are hiring for the position of social media coordinator! Please look over my attached résumé; and I hope you will find my design background combined with my previous marketing experience and current online presence will be just what your company is looking for! Moreover, this would provide me an exciting opportunity to connect in a new and interesting ways with the community I already love.
After gaining valuable experience at a fast paced design firm, Raymond Jungles Inc., I recently began my own business creating and selling Miami inspired stationary and photography online. Additionally, I am currently taking website design classes so that I can continue to build my online presence. I love to acquire new skills and am eager to learn from your company. At RJI, I developed a reputation for doing good work under tight deadlines and increased my responsibilities during my time there, culminating in being promoted to Project Coordinator. I think I will be able to the same for your business. All my previous experience has shown I am capable of learning new concepts, applying them and thriving at them!

I look forward to hearing from you to discuss this opportunity further. I am ready to start immediately, and am excited to become part of the Prism Creative Group Family!

Jaime Russ
